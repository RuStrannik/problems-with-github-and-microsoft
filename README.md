#### An explanation as to why I no longer host my personal repositories on Github and discourage you from doing so.

Github has [entered into an agreement with Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) to be purchased.
Under this agreement, "GitHub will be led by CEO Nat Friedman, an open source veteran and founder of Xamarin, who will continue to report to Microsoft Cloud + AI Group Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie".

Here are some of the things the Microsoft Cloud + AI Group are up to:

 * [Won a 6 year cloud computing agreement with 17 U.S. intelligence agencies](https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2018/05/16/microsoft-ic-pact.aspx)
 * [Wrote about their pride that Azure is mission critical to United States 'Immigrations and Customs Enforcement' (ICE)](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuregov/2018/01/24/federal-agencies-continue-to-advance-capabilities-with-azure-government/).
   Despite [public pushback](https://github.com/taotetek/dear-github-2.0), GitHub got contract to provide Enterprise Servers to the 'Enforcement and Removal Operations' (ERO) division of ICE
 * [Entered the 'Predictive Policing' market, using Chicago as their case study](https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/articles/industries/citynext/safer-cities/predictive-policing-the-future-of-law-enforcement/)
   The Chicago PD is notoriously corrupt. The [Department of Justice investigation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/925846/download) of Chicago's police department found "a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force" and numerous violations of citizens Constitutional rights
 * [Unprecedented open-source software piracy at Github](https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/)
 * Finally, I am just sick of Microsoft stuffing their policies down my throat through GitHub

Efforts of open source community should not be used to help increase the market value and image of a company making billions of dollars enabling surveillance, violence, and human rights abuses.

I am keeping my github account only to communicate information stated above, but I will not host my projects here and will put my best efforts to discourage others from doing so.
